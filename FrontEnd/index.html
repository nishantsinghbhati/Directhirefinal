    about
    At Direct Hire, everything began with a simple yet powerful observation. Ayushi, the founder, started her career in recruitment and quickly noticed a gap in the market — one that affected both sides of the hiring equation. On the client side, companies struggled to find candidates who truly matched their needs. On the candidate side, talented individuals were missing out on the right opportunities, not due to lack of skill, but due to lack of access. Ayushi realized that the system needed a bridge — something that genuinely connected the right talent to the right opportunity. That’s when Direct Hire was born.

  Create a Professional Resume in Minutes with Free CV Maker
We’ve worked with thousands of candidates—and we know one thing for sure: most people struggle with their professional CVs.

Some don’t know what to write. Others copy a friend’s format. And many lose out on great jobs because their resume just didn’t do justice to their potential.

Most online CV builders are generic. They look fancy but miss the point.

That’s why we built something better—a truly free CV Maker designed by recruiters.

We know what hiring managers actually look for. So, our tool does more than just “create a resume”—it guides you through it:

What to include (and what to leave out),
How to format based on your experience level,
And how to highlight your strengths—even if you’re just starting out.

Resume Tips 2025: How to Make Your CV Stand Out
If you're sending out resumes and not hearing back, you're not alone. In fact, one of the most common things we hear at Direct Hire is:

“I’ve applied to so many jobs, but no one's responding.”

More often than not, the issue isn’t your experience. It’s your CV—and how it’s telling your story.

We go through hundreds of resumes every week. And it still surprises us how many great candidates get ignored simply because their resume doesn’t speak the right language.

So, if you're trying to figure out what works in 2025, here are a few things we genuinely recommend—not from theory, but from real experience:

Keep It Straightforward
Let’s be honest—recruiters don’t spend 10 minutes reading every resume.
In reality, you have about 6 to 10 seconds to make an impression.

Be Clear About What You Do
You don’t need to write poetry. Just say what you’re good at.
Tell us what you did, where you worked, and what changed because of you.


Your Summary Matters
Don’t start your CV with a long, generic intro. Most people just copy from a sample online—and it shows.
* Write 2–3 lines about:
* What kind of work you enjoy
* The kind of roles you’re looking for
* And something that gives us a glimpse of your personality

You’re more than a job title. Let that come through, even briefly.

Keep It Updated
Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many resumes still say "seeking internship" when the person has already worked for a year.

Also, if you’ve learned something new—add it. Courses, certifications, side projects—they all count.

Use a Tool That’s Actually Helpful (Not Just “Free”)
Let’s be honest: most “free CV builders” aren't really free.
They let you spend 30 minutes building your resume and then ask for payment before downloading.

That’s why we built our own CV Maker at Direct Hire. It’s designed by recruiters, works well for freshers and professionals alike, and yes—it’s actually free.

You can pick a template, get guided prompts and download your resume

How to Use LinkedIn to Find a Job

1. Make Your Profile a Real Story (Not a List)
Most people treat LinkedIn like a boring version of their resume.
But recruiters don’t want just a list—they want to see your personality, progress, and potential.
Use a clean photo (no filters, no sunglasses)
Add a headline that says more than just your job title
Write an “About” section like you’re talking to someone—not like a robot

2. Let Recruiters Know You’re Open
That little “Open to Work” setting? Use it.
Even if you don’t want the green ring on your profile, you can turn it on privately—so only recruiters see it.
Bonus tip: Add the kind of roles you're open to and preferred location/remote.

3. Be Active (Even if Just Once a Week)
You don’t have to post every day. But a few small actions go a long way:
Comment on posts in your field
Share a helpful article or insight
Like job updates from companies you want to work at
This helps your profile show up more often—and builds trust.

4. Connect Intentionally
Don’t just send random connection requests.
If you're applying somewhere, connect with someone on the team (HR or hiring manager) with a small note. For example:
“Hi! I came across your opening for [Job Title] and would love to connect. I’ve applied through the portal as well.”
It shows effort—and people remember that.

5. Use the Jobs Tab, but Don’t Rely Only on It
LinkedIn’s job board is helpful, yes. But the real magic happens through networking and visibility.
You’d be surprised how many roles are filled before they’re ever posted—just because someone was visible at the right time

LinkedIn isn’t just for top-level professionals anymore. It’s for everyone—freshers, freelancers, and job seekers at every level.
If you use it well, it won’t just help you find a job. It’ll help the job find you.
